                I am a junior at Olathe Northwest High School and am part of the Engineering academy there. I am
                extremely
                interested in game development and robotics. In my freetime I play cello, piano, and chess. I have
                experience
                with Python and C# from classes in school and Unity coding. I want to put my coding skills to use by
                solving real world problems in areas like engineering.
